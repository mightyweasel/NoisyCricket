Part of digital change in the workplace means putting developers and non-developers together. Gone is
the pit. Or maybe more people have joined it. One way or another we have to accept that developer culture
is not everyone's culture.

We know we can be loud, passionate, and sometimes get lost in tech arguments right by someones desk. We know.
Two fries short of a poutine there.

That's why I hacked this together. Some folks on twitter posted some neat code. I snagged it and reshaped it
into this. If you see red, let us know to turn it down. We will. And we wont be offended. 

Let's make amazing things happen together. 

# General Information

Built with good ole basic css, js and htm5. Probably doesnt work in IE. Use chrome for kicks, it's what I built it
for. It's not a pro tool, it's just a series of hacks to accomplish a purpose. Wrote it on the couch.

Sometimes thats all you need.

Hope it helps bring some harmony to the watercoolers and watercooled towers
